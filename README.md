Computer Vision assignments


This assignment makes use of the SIFT descriptor [1].
Specifically, descriptors from two images are gotten and afterwards they are match following two methods (brute force and knnMatch). 

Lastly, a mosaic is created by using descriptors and homographies. 

OpenCV (artificial vision library) is used in this assignment.
