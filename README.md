# Computer-Vision
Computer Vision assignments


This assignment makes use of the SIFT descriptor [1].

Specifically, descriptors from two images are gotten and afterwards they are matched following two methods (brute force and knnMatch). 
Lastly, a mosaic is created by using descriptors and homographies. 

OpenCV (artificial vision library) is used in this assignment.  


# Use

Run main.py and see results. 

In the folder "images" you can find the images used by main.py.
In case you would like to change the images you work with, you need to:

1. Add the image to the image folder.
2. Change the paths of the images in the "main" section in main.py
